## Project brief

Create a full stack application with a Ruby on Rails back-end and an AngularJS front-end. It is required to:

* Connect your Rails back-end to an SQL database and interact with it
* Create at least two models in the SQL database, one being a user model
* Have user authentication where the user's details are stored in the User model in the database
* Create API routes with CRUD functionality using Rails that are to be consumed by the AngularJS front-end
